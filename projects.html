							<h3>Solid Waste Optimization Using XG-SAROpt</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/project/2 architecture.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></span>The project aims to improve traditional waste management systems by utilizing machine learning models like SARIMA and XGBoost. This will help predict waste generation patterns accurately, optimize collection schedules, and reduce operational costs, thereby promoting efficient, cost-effective, and sustainable waste management practices.</p>
							<ul>
								<li>The project uses machine learning to create a predictive waste management framework for urban solid waste management. It uses Kaggle datasets to simulate real-world waste generation scenarios and extracts insights from time-series data.</li>
								<li>The model uses SARIMA, XGBoost, and Meta-Regressor for forecasting waste generation trends. The optimization framework uses Optuna for hyperparameter tuning and dashboards for real-time visualization.</li>
								<li>The framework optimizes waste collection schedules, reduces operational costs, and promotes sustainable urban development. </li>

							<h3>Voice-Controlled and Obstacle-Avoiding Robotic Car</h3>
							<p><span class="image right"><img src="images/project/Screenshot 2024-12-26 174356.png" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></span>The project aims to create a robotic car that uses voice recognition and obstacle detection to enable safe navigation. Users can control the car's movements via a smartphone app, and it uses ultrasonic sensors to detect obstacles. The project focuses on accessibility and safety, allowing control without physical interaction.</p> 
							<p>Hardware requirements include:</p>
							<ul>
								<li>Arduino Uno microcontroller</li>
								<li>HC-05 Bluetooth module</li>
								<li>L298N motor driver</li>
								<li>ultrasonic sensor</li>
								<li>DC motors</li>
								<li>12V rechargeable battery</li>
							</ul>
							</ul>
							<p>Software requirements include:</p>
								<li>Arduino IDE</li>
								<li>MIT App Inventor</li>
							</ul>
							<p>The methodology involves pairing the HC-05 Bluetooth module with a smartphone, converting voice commands into text using Google's speech recognition technology, and controlling the motor driver. The ultrasonic sensors continuously monitor obstacles and initiate evasive actions if detected.</p>
